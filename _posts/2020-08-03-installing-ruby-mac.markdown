I recently tried installing ruby on my mac and faced a lot of challenges during the install. 
I really hope this guide helps.


[Ruby ](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is a great programming language for developing complex web applications. (makes it look like magic!). 
I felt I dive deeper into ruby ([ruby on rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)) after observing the ease with which you can do some much very quickly with very little code.

so here are the commands you need to run to get you started.

Replace <user> with your username

That's it and you are up and running! 
happy coding
