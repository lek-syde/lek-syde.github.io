This is a proposed solution, with the ever-increasing rate of a gas plant explosion in Nigeria,[here](https://nairametrics.com/2020/10/08/breaking-gas-station-explodes-in-ipaja-lagos-claims-property-and-valuables/#:~:text=Another%20gas%20explosion%20has%20rocked,State%20Emergency%20Agency%20(LASEMA).) 
I thought I might make a sketch of a possible solution to the problem.
