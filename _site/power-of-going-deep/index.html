       <p>‚ÄúDeep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúShallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.‚Äù</p>

<p>There are many ways to discover that you‚Äôre not valuable in our economy. For Jason Benn the lesson was made clear when he realized, not long after taking a job as a financial consultant, that the vast majority of his work responsibilities could be automated by a ‚Äúmuddled together‚Äù Excel script.
</p>
<p>The firm that hired Benn produced reports for banks involved in complex deals. (‚ÄúIt was about as interesting as it sounds,‚Äù Benn joked in one of our interviews.) The report creation process required hours of manual manipulation of data in a series of Excel spreadsheets. When he first arrived, it took Benn up to six hours per report to finish this stage (the most efficient veterans at the firm could complete this task in around half the time). This didn‚Äôt sit well with Benn.
The way it was taught to me, the process seemed clunky and manually intensive,‚Äù Benn recalls. He knew that Excel has a feature called macros that allows users to automate common tasks. Benn read articles on the topic and soon put together a new worksheet, wired up with a series of these macros that could take the six-hour process of manual data manipulation and replace it, essentially, with a button click. A report-writing process that originally took him a full workday could now be reduced to less than an hour.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBenn is a smart guy. He graduated from an elite college (the University of Virginia) with a degree in economics, and like many in his situation he had ambitions for his career. It didn‚Äôt take him long to realize that these ambitions would be thwarted so long as his main professional skills could be captured in an Excel macro. He decided, therefore, he needed to increase his value to the world. After a period of research, Benn reached a conclusion: He would, he declared to his family, quit his job as a human spreadsheet and become a computer programmer. As is often the case with such grand plans, however, there was a hitch: Jason Benn had no idea how to write code.
As a computer scientist I can confirm an obvious point: Programming computers is hard. Most new developers dedicate a four-year college education to learning the ropes before their first job‚Äîand even then, competition for the best spots is fierce. Jason Benn didn‚Äôt have this time. After his Excel epiphany, he quit his job at the financial firm and moved home to prepare for his next step. His parents were happy he had a plan, but they weren‚Äôt happy about the idea that this return home might be long-term. Benn needed to learn a hard skill, and needed to do so fast.</p>

<p>Jason Benn‚Äôs story highlights a crucial lesson: Deep work is not some nostalgic affectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers. It‚Äôs instead a skill that has great value today.
There are two reasons for this value. The first has to do with learning. We have an information economy that‚Äôs dependent on complex systems that change rapidly. Some of the computer languages Benn learned, for example, didn‚Äôt exist ten years ago and will likely be outdated ten years from now. Similarly, someone coming up in the field of marketing in the 1990s probably had no idea that today they‚Äôd need to master digital analytics. To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don‚Äôt cultivate this ability, you‚Äôre likely to fall behind as technology advances.
The second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful, its reachable audience (e.g., employers or customers) is essentially limitless‚Äîwhich greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if what you‚Äôre producing is mediocre, then you‚Äôre in trouble, as it‚Äôs too easy for your audience to find a better alternative online. Whether you‚Äôre a computer programmer, writer, marketer, consultant, or ‚Äúentrepreneur, your situation has become similar to Jason Benn trying to hold his own in a hot start-up: To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you‚Äôre capable of producing‚Äîa task that requires depth.
When Carl Jung wanted to revolutionize the field of psychiatry, he built a retreat in the woods. Jung‚Äôs Bollingen Tower became a place where he could maintain his ability to think deeply and then apply the skill to produce work of such stunning originality that it changed the world. In the pages ahead, I‚Äôll try to convince you to join me in the effort to build our own personal Bollingen Towers; to cultivate an ability to produce real value in an increasingly distracted world; and to recognize a truth embraced by the most productive and important personalities of generations past: A deep life is a good life.</p>
